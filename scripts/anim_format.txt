This is the file spec for .amesh and .anim files. The .amesh files contains the 
vertex, normal, bones, and texCoord information. The .anim file will contain
the animation information. Lets try to derive a new format. Here is the .amesh
format format

version [int(version_number)]
bone
[int(id)] [string(name)] [int(parent)]+
end
transform
[mat4]
end
vertex
[int(boneID)] [vec3(vertex)] [vec3(normal)]+
end
texCoord
[vec2]+
end
face
[int3(vertex_indencies)] [int3(texCoord_indencies)]+
end

Here is the .anim format spec.
version [int(version_num)]
frame [int(frame_num)]+
bone [int(id)] [mat4(transform)]+
end
