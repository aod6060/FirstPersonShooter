FirstPersonShooter
==================

This is going to be a First Person Shooter game made from scratch. This simple project is going to be used to help me
understand how first person shooters work. The project itself is under a mit license. All of the libraries are included
for convience so no one has to go through dependency hell to find all of the libraries the project is using. I'll alter
this file when I finally have a working game.
